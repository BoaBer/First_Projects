Expense_Tracker - I wrote Expense_Tracker to plan and control expenses. Expenses are saved in the LocalStorage of the browser. In the program we can add past and planned expenses, there are 5 expense categories: food, clothes, cosmetics, entertainment, sport. Past and future expenses are displayed separately, switching between them is realised by a slider on the right hand side. In addition, it is possible to segregate all entered expenses by date, category or both at the same time, and to display them in 4 options: date ascending/descending, amount ascending/descending. Below the slider is the total expense, which changes according to the filters set, so that we can easily compare expenses according to need. The calendar under "New expense" shows the current date and by clicking on the relevant day, the expenses for that day are displayed. By default, I have sorted past expenses (including today's) by date in descending order (today's date is at the very top and the oldest at the very bottom), and future expenses by date in ascending order (the closest expense will be at the very top, and the furthest expense in time will be at the very bottom).
